# Basic-Arithmetic-Calculator-using-Javascript
I use Javascript to build Basic Arithmetic Calculator that canperform basic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, & Division.

The Calculator also has the ability to detect where input error(s), lies if it's unable to execute the given operation
I also include a button that upon clicking will reload the calculator again for new operation instead of refreshing the page everytime.
